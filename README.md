# PyThia
PyThia performs video prediction for simple physical systems: given initial video frames, what will a video frame in the future look like?

## Start here!

The easiest way to see what PyThia can do is to peruse the demonstration notebook.
It is available as an [interactive notebook](
    https://colab.research.google.com/github/aremondtiedrez/pythia/blob/main/demo.ipynb
) served via Google Colab.

## Why the name `PyThia`?
The objective of this project is to predict what will happen in the future,
more specifically predicting what will happen in the future of a video
whose initial frames are given as input.
This project is therefore named after a famous oracle purpoting to divine the future:
in Ancient Greece the Pythia served as oracle at the temple of Apollo, in Delphi.

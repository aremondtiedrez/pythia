# PyThia
PyThia performs video prediction: given initial video frames, what will a video frame in the future look like?

## Why `PyThia`?
The objective of this project is to predict what will happen in the future,
more specifically predicting what will happen in the future of a video
whose initial frames are given as input.
This project is therefore named after a famous oracle purpoting to divine the future:
in Ancient Greece the Pythia served as oracle at the temple of Apollo, in Delphi.
